### Discount Distribution

- **24% discount:** 1 segment (Syahril - Sini and Associates 24%)
- **20% discount:** 2 segments (KPCDI, Syahril - Sini and Associates 20%)
- **15% discount:** 11 segments (Most PT companies, travel agents, event organizers)
- **14% discount:** 1 segment (Anata tour and Travel)
- **10% discount:** 2 segments (Avatar Sejagad Bandung, PT Alfa Star Indonesia)
- **0% discount:** 3 segments (Standard Corporate, Golkar, PT Stars Internasional)

## Frontend Implementation

### Updated Files

1. **registrasi.jsx** - Guest Registration Form
2. **reservasi.jsx** - Hotel Reservation Form

### Filtering Logic

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    if (formData.category_market === 'Corporate Rate') {
        const corporateSegments = marketSegments.filter(segment => 
            segment.name.toLowerCase().includes('corporate') || 
            (segment.category && segment.category.toLowerCase() === 'corporate rate')
        );
        setFilteredMarketSegments(corporateSegments);
    }
    // ... other categories (Walkin, OTA, etc.)
}, [formData.category_market, marketSegments]);
```

### How It Works

1. When a user selects "Corporate Rate" from the Category Market dropdown
2. The market segment dropdown automatically filters to show only corporate segments
3. Users can then select from the 20 available corporate client segments
4. The selected segment's discount is automatically applied to the booking

## Backend Scripts

### 1. add_corporate_segments.py
- Main script to add all 20 corporate segments to the database
- Includes safety checks for existing segments
- Transaction-based to ensure data integrity
- Displays verification after successful insertion

### 2. verify_corporate_segments.py
- Verification script to check all corporate segments in the database
- Shows discount distribution summary
- Useful for auditing and confirming data integrity

### 3. check_column_length.py
- Utility script to check database column constraints
- Used to identify the 50-character limit on segment names
- Helped resolve the KPCDI naming issue

## Technical Details

### Database Configuration
- **Table:** market_segments
- **Category Field:** 'Corporate Rate' (varchar)
- **Name Field:** Max 50 characters
- **Discount Field:** Decimal (percentage)
- **All segments are active by default**

### Name Length Constraint
Due to the 50-character limit on the `name` column:
- "Komunitas Pasien Cuci Darah Indonesia (KPCDI)" was shortened to "KPCDI"
- Full name preserved in the description field
- Format: "Corporate - [Client Name]" (max 50 chars total)

## Category System

The hotel system now supports three main market segment categories with automatic filtering:

1. **Walkin** - 41 segments for walk-in customers with various promotions
2. **Online Travel Agent (OTA)** - 10 segments for online booking platforms (0% discount)
3. **Corporate Rate** - 20 segments for corporate clients (0% to 24% discounts)

Other categories exist but use general filtering (Government Rate, Group, Travel Agent, Social Media, WAWCARD, SMS Blast).

## Git Commit

2. **Database Testing:**

   - Check discount percentages match requirements
   - Verify category field is correctly set to "Corporate Rate"

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Create test reservations for each corporate client
   - Verify discounts are correctly calculated
   - Test reporting and analytics with corporate bookings

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the corporate rate system:

1. **Dynamic Rate Management:**
   - Admin interface to add/edit/remove corporate clients
   - Bulk upload functionality for corporate rates
   - Expiration dates for corporate contracts

2. **Reporting:**
   - Corporate client booking reports
   - Revenue analysis by corporate segment
   - Discount utilization tracking

3. **Validation:**
   - Corporate authorization codes
   - Credit limit tracking
   - Invoice generation for corporate accounts

## Notes

- All corporate segments follow the naming convention: "Corporate - [Client Name]"
- Syahril - Sini and Associates has two separate segments for 20% and 24% discounts
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing market segments
- Frontend filtering ensures users only see relevant segments for their selected category
