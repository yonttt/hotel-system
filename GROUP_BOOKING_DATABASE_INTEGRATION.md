# Group Booking Database Integration - Testing Guide

## ✅ Completed Integration

All Group Booking form fields are now fully integrated with your database, matching the functionality of registrasi and reservasi forms.

## Database-Connected Fields

### Group Information Section
- **Payment Method**: Loads from `payment_methods` table via SearchableSelect

### Room Booking Section (Per Room)
1. **Room Number**: 
   - Loads available rooms (status='VR') from `hotel_rooms` table
   - Shows: Room Number - Room Type (Floor X) - Hit: X
   - Format matches registrasi form exactly
   - Automatically fetches pricing when selected

2. **Guest Details**:
   - **Nationality**: Loads from `countries` table via SearchableSelect
   - **City**: Loads from `cities` table via SearchableSelect
   - Both use searchable dropdowns for easy selection

3. **Room Rate & Pricing**:
   - Automatically fetched from `room_pricing` table when room selected
   - Falls back to room's base rate if pricing not found
   - Real-time calculation: Subtotal = (Rate - Discount) × Nights

## API Methods Used

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Before Testing
- [ ] Backend server running (http://localhost:8000)
- [ ] Frontend server running (http://localhost:5173 or 5174)
- [ ] Database tables created (group_bookings, group_booking_rooms)
- [ ] Test data available:
  - At least 2 available rooms (status='VR')
  - Payment methods in database
  - Cities in database
  - Countries/nationalities in database

### ✅ Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Load Form with Database Data
1. Navigate to Registrasi or Reservasi page
2. Click "Group Booking" button
3. Verify dropdowns are populated:
   - Payment Method shows data from database
   - Room Number shows available rooms with floor and hit count
   - City shows cities from database
   - Nationality shows INDONESIA first, then other countries

**Expected Result**: All dropdowns show database data, searchable

#### Test 2: Room Selection with Pricing
1. In Room #1, click Room Number dropdown
2. Search and select a room (e.g., "101")
3. Verify:
   - Room Type auto-fills
   - Rate auto-fills from room_pricing table
   - Subtotal calculates: (Rate - 0) × Nights

**Expected Result**: Rate fetched from database, subtotal calculated

#### Test 3: Add Multiple Rooms
1. Click "+ Add Room" button
2. Select different room for Room #2
3. Verify:
   - First selected room not shown in second dropdown
   - Each room gets its own pricing
   - Total Amount updates with sum of all rooms

**Expected Result**: Dynamic room filtering, accurate totals

#### Test 4: Searchable Dropdowns
1. Click City dropdown
2. Type to search (e.g., "JAK" for Jakarta)
3. Verify filtering works
4. Select a city
5. Repeat for Nationality and Payment Method

**Expected Result**: All SearchableSelect fields support typing to filter

#### Test 5: Copy Guest Info
1. Fill guest details in Room #1 (name, ID, phone, nationality, city, address)
2. Add Room #2
3. Click "Copy Info to All" button in Room #1
4. Verify Room #2 gets copied guest details (but keeps its own room selection)

**Expected Result**: Guest info copied, room number stays different

#### Test 6: Automatic Calculations
1. Fill all required fields
2. Change "Nights" field
3. Verify subtotals update for all rooms
4. Change "Deposit" amount

2. Click "Create Group Booking"
3. Verify success message shows:
   - Group ID (e.g., GRP-1729756800)
   - Total Rooms count
   - Total Amount

**Expected Result**: Success message, form resets

#### Test 8: Verify Database Records
After successful submission, check database:

```sql
-- Check group booking header
SELECT * FROM group_bookings ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check room details
SELECT * FROM group_booking_rooms 
WHERE group_booking_id = 'GRP-XXXXXXXXXX'
ORDER BY created_at;

-- Check hotel_reservations (compatibility)
SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations 
WHERE member_id = 'GRP-XXXXXXXXXX'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

**Expected Result**: 
- 1 record in group_bookings
- N records in group_booking_rooms (N = number of rooms)
- N records in hotel_reservations with same member_id

### ✅ Error Handling Tests

#### Test 9: Network Error Handling
1. Stop backend server
2. Try to load Group Booking page
3. Verify error message shown

**Expected Result**: Graceful error message, no crash

#### Test 10: Validation

2. Verify error: "Group name is required"
3. Try to submit with empty Payment Method
4. Verify error: "Payment method is required"
5. Try to submit with room missing guest name
6. Verify error: "All rooms must have room number and guest name filled"

**Expected Result**: Clear validation messages
